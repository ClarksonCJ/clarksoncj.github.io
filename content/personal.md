## Meet Chris: Security Architect, Engineer, Consultant, Geek, Father

Hello there! I'm Chris, an experienced technology professional with a diverse background across IT, Security and Software Development. My world revolves around
Cyber Security, with a focus on Security Architecture, Purple Teaming, and Cloud Technology. I'm all about understanding threats, designing robust security solutions and rigorously testing them to ensure they perform flawlessly.

## Lifelong Learning: My Mantra

In the field of cybersecurity, the learning never stops. I live by the adage "knowledge is power," and I'm
constantly motorcycling to learn something new. As [Simon Sinek](https://www.simonsinek.com/) says, finding your "Why"
leads to fulfillment and passion. My "Why," or [Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai), is simple yet profound:
I strive to educate, inform, and empower people and business to use technology safely and securely. If I can make technology more secure and
stress-free for users, I consider it a win.

## More Than Just Cybersecurity

Beyond Cybersecurity I pursue a number of hobbies, developing my creative side with 3D Modelling and Printing, improving my mind and body with Karate and the gym, and escaping into the virtual worlds of PC Gaming, particularly Adventure RPGs.
In the face of all of the stresses of the world, work and play, my family is my anchor – chasing around after my two kids and spending time with my wonderful wife keeps me grounded.
