## Meet Chris: Your Cybersecurity Guide and Geek-at-Heart

Hello there! I'm Chris, your friendly neighborhood Hacker, Engineer, and self-proclaimed Geek. My world revolves around
Cyber Security, with my focus on Security Architecture, Purple Teaming, and Cloud Technology. I'm all about
designing robust security solutions and rigorously testing them to ensure they perform flawlessly.

## Lifelong Learning: My Mantra

In the dynamic realm of cybersecurity, the learning never stops. I live by the adage "knowledge is power," and I'm
constantly on a quest to learn something new. As [Simon Sinek](https://www.simonsinek.com/) says, finding your "Why"
leads to fulfillment and passion. My "Why," or [Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai), is simple yet profound:
I aim to educate, inform, and empower people to use the internet safely. If I can make the internet a more secure and
stress-free place for users, I consider it a mission accomplished.

## More Than Just Cybersecurity

When I'm not deep in the digital trenches, you'll find me enjoying the thrill of motorcycling, the focus of Karate, or
the complexity of a bouldering problem. Family is my anchor – chasing around after my two kids and spending time with my wonderful wife keeps me
grounded. Recently, I've dived into the fascinating world of 3D printing. It's a delightful hobby that allows me
to go from digital idea to physical reality.
