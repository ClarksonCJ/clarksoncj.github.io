### **A Security Architect, Geek, and Lifelong Learner**

Hi, I’m Chris Clarkson, a Security Architect and Engineer with 20+ years of diverse experience across IT, security, and software development. I’ve worn many hats—from SysAdmin to Developer to DevOps lead—and now, I focus on designing secure solutions for cloud environments, software supply chains, and beyond. Security isn’t just a job for me; it’s a way of life. Whether working with clients on cloud-native security solutions or testing defenses through offensive security methods, I thrive on tackling complex challenges with creative, scalable solutions.

### **Beyond Work: The Creative Maker**

While security takes center stage in my professional life, I’m also a maker and creative thinker. I enjoy tinkering with 3D printing, electronics, and modeling projects, where tech meets craftsmanship. When I’m not experimenting with new ideas, I’m at the gym, practicing Karate, or escaping into the world of sci-fi and fantasy—think WH40K, MCU, LoTR, and RPG games.

My family keeps me grounded, and nothing beats chasing after my two kids or spending time with my wife. Together, they are my anchor and greatest source of inspiration.

### **A Philosophy of Continuous Growth**

I live by the principle of lifelong learning. For me, cybersecurity isn’t just about protecting systems—it’s about evolving and educating others to use technology safely. As Simon Sinek’s concept of finding your “Why” resonates deeply with me, I’ve made it my mission to empower businesses to navigate the digital world securely. If I can help make someone’s technological experience smoother and safer, I consider it a job well done.
