Hello there dear reader! Just landed a new gig in the buzzing world of cybersecurity? Awesome! I'm right there with you, having recently
started a new role myself. Let me share some insider tips that have really helped me get my bearings in these first few days.

First things first, make day one count. Whether you're a veteran in the field or fresh-faced and eager, the way you kick
things off can set the tone for your entire journey. Here's how I've been navigating the early days at
my new company, and trust me, it's been a game-changer. Let's jump right in!

## Update your records

The majority of companies have fixed dates for when they process your benefits, salary, etc. For peace of mind log
into the HR system in your first few days and make sure that info is correct and up to date so you get paid on time and your benefits take
effect.

__Takeaway:__ Be sure to get your records up to date as soon as possible so you dont miss out on that first payroll, or
enrolment onto your benefits.

## Attend and participate in Onboarding Sessions

Attending onboarding sessions is more than just a formality. These sessions are goldmines of information about how your
new company operates. Plus, they're great opportunities to meet fellow newcomers. Pro tip: jot down the names and roles
of your peers. They could be your gateway to understanding and collaborating with other teams in the future.

__Takeaway:__ They may not be the most exciting of events in your calendar but they are an invaluable source of information, so
embrace them and get as much from them as you can.

## Customize Your Workstation

Setting up your device to your preferences is key to doing your best work. Familiarity breeds comfort, and in the
whirlwind of a new role, a bit of comfort goes a long way. Take time to tweak your settings, personalize your tools,
and create a workspace that feels like home. This not only helps in reducing stress but also increases productivity.
Nothing ingratiates you better with your new team than being an effective member as quickly as possible.

__Takeaway:__ Whether you have a comprehensive dotfiles setup to install, or prefer manually setting up your tools,
spend some time doing so. It will give you a sense of accomplishment and comfort of the familiar.

## Connect with Your Manager

Understanding your role and expectations early on is crucial. Discuss with your manager what you should aim to achieve
in your first week, month, quarter, and year. Get clarity on your responsibilities and the projects you'll be involved
with. This roadmap will help you stay focused and on track.

__Takeaway:__ Your manager is both a source of knowledge, and support throughout your time in the role. Its important to
make a positive start to that relationship.

## Embrace Hands-On Learning

Speak with your manager, team lead, or buddy about some early tasks that don't require extensive "tribal knowledge" of
the team, or the company. Engaging in these kinds of tasks allow you to learn by doing and gain familiarity with the systems and processes
 without the pressure of knowing all the shortcuts. Early wins are also important for confidence and can help in combating imposter syndrome.

__Takeaway:__  You will learn more by doing than by reading endless wiki's. "Good first issue" type tasks give you
opportunity to show off your skills relatively early in your tenure, not to mention the confidence boost that comes
with it.

## Grow your network

Find out the key people you should connect with and set up meetings with them. Understanding how your role intersects
with theirs and asking about their responsibilities can provide valuable insights. This also helps build your
 network.

__Takeaway:__ Its not just what you know, its who you know too. Take the time and effort to develop your network in the new role,
starting with your team mates. They will have the greatest bearing on your success in the early days.

## Create a "Second Brain"

Start compiling a "Second Brain" â€“ a personal knowledge base where you document everything. This could include notes on
company processes, system quirks, and access issues. Tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so) or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
can be great for this. This habit will be invaluable as you navigate through your role and beyond.

__Takeaway:__ Starting any new role is like "drinking from the firehose", you will need some way to organise the information
you are getting in a way that makes sense to you. There are lots of tools and techniques to help, use them.

## It's all about balance

Join groups on Slack or other platforms that interest you. Conversations about hobbies or non-work topics are essential
for a balanced work life. They provide a necessary break from work and help in building relationships with your colleagues.

__Takeaway:__ Most companies have groups, channels, meetups, etc. for non-work or work "adjacent" interests. When
you get settled in, consider participating in ones that take your fancy, they are a good way to meet
likeminded people at your company and maybe make some friends.

## Intelligence Operations

When I started at a previous firm, a new colleague shared his view that Security was like an intelligence agency and to remember that
not only are you mitigating risks, implementing controls, and improving the safety of the service for your customers; you are in a position
to see behind the curtain of areas of the business that most never see. Going further to explain that the people you meet,
the work you do, and the objectives you are aiming for are all intertwined and give you a unique and powerful
perspective on the business and its outcomes, and that you can use that interconnectedness as a force multiplier.
I had never thought of it that way before, but it made a lot of sense very quickly as I became more and more immersed in the company. As I was
meeting people, and working with teams across the organisation, I came to understand their motivations and incentives, and was better able to align what
I needed from them, and what they needed from me.

A great example of the insight you can glean, is that there may be a perception that security is a high priority
for the company, but from the perspective of an engineering team the priority is on feature delivery. That priority is dictated by the
incentives for the team, and how that drives their motivations. They may have the most secure product in the world, but if they havent met
their commitments then they arent seen as being successful and so will miss out on the "rewards" from being a successful engineering delivery team.
The "Intel" you gather as you move through the company allows you to understand perspective, rather than relying only on perception.

At its core, this "Intel" is a tool essential for interpreting and communicating security requests clearly and effectively.
It bridges the gap between perception and perspective, and helps ensure that security outcomes are understood
and aligned with the outcomes of the individual, team and business. This approach not only facilitates informed decision
-making but also builds trust and cooperation across various departments, mirroring the role of an intelligence agency in
synthesizing and disseminating critical information for not only the company's wellbeing, but for the individuals and teams as well.

__Takeaway:__ You'll interact with various parts of the business, and be exposed to a wealth of information. Keep expanding
your "Second Brain" with this info. Dont forget to add some of your own context to this information aswell and it can reveal new
perspectives and insights that really help you amplify your successes.

Starting a new role in cybersecurity can be both challenging and exhilarating. These tips will
not only ease your transition into the new role but also lay a strong foundation for a successful career in this dynamic
field.

Keep learning, stay curious, and most importantly, enjoy the journey!
