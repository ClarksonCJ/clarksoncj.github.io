## Introduction

I've been thinking a lot lately about threat modelling. It's not just because it's a core aspect of
my work, but because we apply the basic principles of threat modelling in almost everything we do.

As professionals in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity, we often find ourselves enmeshed
in a complex web of threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies. Our daily work revolves
around anticipating potential risks and safeguarding our digital assets. However, one
concept that I believe holds significant value, not just in our professional domain
but in our everyday lives, is risk awareness. Adopting a risk awareness doctrine — a decision-making
framework rooted in identifying and assessing risks—can profoundly enhance
both our professional work and personal lives.

## But What is a Doctrine?

A doctrine, in its essence, is a set of principles or a decision-making framework that
guides our actions and judgments. It provides a structured approach to problem-solving
and helps us navigate complex scenarios by applying consistent logic and reasoning.
In the context of risk awareness, a doctrine would involve systematically evaluating
potential risks, understanding their implications, and making informed decisions
to mitigate those risks. That doctrine can be referred to as **Threat Modelling**.

While the term indoctrination has sinister overtones in many contexts, fundamentally it is
the adoption of a decision making process whether that is for a single person, or group of people

Doctrines often form the foundation of strategies in a business context. While a
strategy is a sequence of tactics aimed at achieving a specific objective, a doctrine
is the underlying framework that informs these strategies. It becomes intrinsic to
how a business or individual operates, guiding decision-making processes and
ensuring consistency and resilience. The doctrine persists beyond the completion of
any single objective, continuously shaping actions and judgments

## The Importance of a Risk Awareness Doctrine

Incorporating risk awareness into our daily decision-making can transform how we
handle both routine and complex situations. When we adopt this practice as
part of our everyday thinking, it helps us proactively identify and address
potential risks, enhancing the quality and security of our professional work and
personal lives.

By consciously practicing risk assessment, we gain a clearer understanding of
our personal risk tolerances. This self-awareness allows us to recognize when
we're being overly risk-averse, especially in critical areas like pursuing new
opportunities or deciding to let them pass. Understanding our risk tolerance helps
us strike a balance between caution and boldness, as they say "Fortune favours the bold, but the second mouse gets the cheese",

When we lean on the teachings of Sun Tzu, "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles"
The combination of Risk awareness and self-awareness leads to more informed and confident decisions with beneficial outcomes.

Our personal risk tolerances significantly impact our work, particularly when
considering the business's risk tolerance. Aligning our individual risk
assessments with the organization's risk framework is crucial. If we're too
conservative, we might miss out on opportunities that benefit the business.
Conversely, taking excessive risks might exceed the company’s acceptable threshold,
leading to conflicts or setbacks.

By integrating personal risk awareness with an understanding of the
business’s risk tolerance, we contribute to a balanced and effective decision-making
process. This alignment ensures our actions reflect both our own risk
perspectives and the organization's strategic objectives. Let's explore
how this doctrine can be applied across various aspects of life.
