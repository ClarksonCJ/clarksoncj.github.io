## Introduction

Imagine being able to foresee potential risks in both your professional projects and
everyday life—how much more prepared and confident would you feel?
This is where threat modeling comes in.

As professionals in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity, we often find ourselves enmeshed
in a complex web of threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies. Our daily work revolves
around anticipating potential risks and safeguarding our digital assets. However, one
concept that I believe holds significant value, not just in our professional domain
but in our everyday lives, is risk awareness. Adopting a risk awareness doctrine — a decision-making
framework rooted in identifying and assessing risks—can profoundly enhance
both our professional work and personal lives.

## But What is a Doctrine?

A doctrine is a structured set of principles guiding our decisions and actions.
In the context of risk awareness, it helps us systematically evaluate and
mitigate risks. It provides a structured approach to problem-solving
and helps us navigate complex scenarios by applying consistent logic and reasoning.
In the context of risk awareness, a doctrine would involve systematically evaluating
potential risks, understanding their implications, and making informed decisions
to mitigate those risks. That doctrine can be referred to as **Threat Modelling**.

While the term indoctrination has sinister overtones in many contexts, fundamentally it is
the adoption of a decision making process whether that is for a single person, or group of people

Doctrines often form the foundation of strategies in a business context. While a
strategy is a sequence of tactics aimed at achieving a specific objective, a doctrine
is the underlying framework that informs these strategies. It becomes intrinsic to
how a business or individual operates, guiding decision-making processes and
ensuring consistency and resilience. The doctrine persists beyond the completion of
any single objective, continuously shaping actions and judgments

## The Importance of a Risk Awareness Doctrine

Incorporating risk awareness into our daily decision-making can transform how we
handle both routine and complex situations. When we adopt this practice as part
of our everyday thinking, it helps us proactively identify and address potential
risks, enhancing the quality and security of our professional work and personal lives.

By consciously practicing risk assessment, we gain a clearer understanding of
our personal risk tolerances. This self-awareness allows us to recognize
when we're being overly risk-averse, especially in critical areas like
pursuing new opportunities or deciding to let them pass. Understanding our
risk tolerance helps us strike a balance between caution and boldness. As
they say, "Fortune favors the bold, but the second mouse gets the cheese."

Drawing on the teachings of Sun Tzu, "If you know the enemy and know yourself,
you need not fear the result of a hundred battles." Combining risk awareness
with self-awareness leads to more informed and confident decisions,
often resulting in beneficial outcomes.

Our personal risk tolerances significantly impact our work, particularly
when considering the risk tolerance of the business. Aligning our individual
risk assessments with the organization's risk framework is crucial. If
we're too conservative, we might miss out on opportunities. Conversely,
taking excessive risks might exceed the company’s acceptable threshold, leading to
conflicts or setbacks.

By integrating personal risk awareness with an understanding of the
business’s risk tolerance, we contribute to a balanced and
effective decision-making process. This alignment ensures our
actions reflect both our own risk perspectives and the
organization's strategic objectives. Let's explore how this
doctrine can be applied across various aspects of life.

## Risk Aware Software Engineering

As software engineers and cybersecurity professionals, risk awareness is
a critical aspect of our development lifecycle. By envisioning potential
risks from the outset, we can design systems that are inherently more secure.
This proactive approach helps in identifying vulnerabilities early, allowing
us to implement robust security measures before they become exploitable.

However, despite its importance, there often lacks sufficient motivation and
incentives for engineers to practice threat modelling as a core part of their
work. The pressure to meet tight deadlines and deliver functional features can
overshadow the need to invest time in comprehensive threat assessments. Additionally,
the immediate benefits of threat modelling may not be as visible or rewarding as
launching a new feature, leading to a deprioritization of this essential practice.

For instance, consider a scenario where you are developing a new web application.
By applying risk awareness, you would systematically identify potential attack vectors,
such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. This foresight enables you to build
safeguards, such as input validation and proper error handling, directly into your
code, thereby fortifying your application against these threats. However, without
proper incentives, engineers might skip these crucial steps, focusing instead on
delivering visible features that attract user attention and business approval.

To address this, organizations need to foster a culture that values security as much
as functionality. This can be achieved by integrating threat modelling into the
standard development process, providing training and resources to enhance engineers'
skills in this area, and recognizing and rewarding efforts that contribute to building
secure systems. By doing so, we can ensure that risk awareness becomes an integral part
of our professional practice, leading to the development of more resilient and secure software.

On the other hand, without a solid decision-making framework to underpin these risk
awareness practices, improperly managed risk can adversely affect the business. While
it's crucial to address potential security threats, it's equally important to balance
security concerns with the need to deliver a functional product. The reality is that a
product carrying some level of risk, released to market, is better than a
risk-free product that is never released.

A well-defined doctrine of risk assessment helps in making these tough decisions by providing
a structured approach to evaluate and balance risks against business goals. This
ensures that security measures are prioritized appropriately without stalling development.
For example, not all identified risks might warrant immediate action; some can be mitigated
through future updates or addressed as part of a broader risk management strategy.

By embedding a decision-making framework into the development process, businesses
can achieve a harmonious balance where security does not impede progress, but rather
complements it. This balanced approach ensures that the organization can innovate
and grow while maintaining a robust security posture.

## Everyday Risk Awareness

Risk awareness isn't confined to the realm of software development; it can be seamlessly
integrated into our everyday lives. Imagine you're crossing the road. Instinctively,
you look both ways to assess oncoming traffic and potential hazards. This simple act
mirrors the risk awareness process—identifying threats (vehicles), assessing risks
(speed and distance of oncoming traffic), and making an informed decision (when to cross).

Similarly, when deciding to participate in an adventurous activity, applying a risk awareness doctrine
can help you have a fantastic experience with minimal downside. By considering factors
such as the reputation of the provider, the quality of the equipment, and the
safety protocols in place, you can ensure your experience will be memorable for
all the right reasons.

This approach has its uses in the world of business and finance too. Imagine an
investment opportunity that promises a 30% return per year but requires that you
invest your life savings. You weigh the threats (economic uncertainty, your own
financial stability, etc.) against the risks (loss of investment, a lower return, change in circumstances)
and from there make a decision (weighed against your risk tolerance).

The more practiced you are at risk awareness, the faster you can make these calculations
and ultimately a decision. Fear of the unknown is often paralyzing; risk awareness
should liberate you from that fear.

Remember our famous bon mot: "Fortune favors the bold, but the second mouse gets the cheese."
Keep in mind that the 10th mouse gets crumbs (or another enterprising mouse offering
all the cheese they could want for a low, low price).

As with anything you seek to master, the key is consistency. The more you practice being
conscious of the risks around you, the better you become at it, and the easier it
gets. Over time, this skillset becomes more instinctual. You can quickly look at a situation,
effectively weigh up the risks, balance them against your tolerances, and
proceed confidently in your decision.

It's worth noting that spontaneity and risk awareness are not mutually exclusive
concepts. The most spontaneous individuals are often the most risk-aware. Their
instinctual understanding allows them to balance risk and tolerance in an instant,
moving forward without fear. Spontaneity without risk awareness could be considered
recklessness; while thrilling in some cases, it increases the likelihood of extreme outcomes.

By incorporating a risk awareness doctrine into our daily lives, we can navigate
both everyday activities and extraordinary adventures with a greater sense of
security and confidence. This approach not only enhances our personal safety but
also enriches our experiences, allowing us to make the most of every opportunity
while minimizing potential downsides.

## Your Perspective Determines Your Reality

Initially, thinking within a risk awareness doctrine can be challenging. It
requires a shift in mindset, and the process may feel cumbersome or unnatural.
However, with practice and persistence, this approach will become second nature.
Over time, you will instinctively identify and assess risks, much like how
experienced drivers intuitively gauge traffic conditions.

The perspective shift that would benefit most engineering organizations (and likely
extend beyond engineering) is understanding that "risk awareness" and "threat modelling"
are not esoteric practices reserved for security and compliance teams. By democratizing
these skills, tools, and doctrines, and enabling more people to perform risk awareness
activities, these practices become ubiquitous and embedded. Subtle adjustments to the
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
encourages incorporating these behaviors earlier and more frequently.

The concept of a security champion, be that a member of the team, or a nominated contact
on the security team, has fostered the idea that someone "security-minded" is there to handle threat modelling.
In reality, this champion should be knowledge sharing and facilitating the
team to threat model and analyze risks in their delivery. The ultimate goal
is for the team to become self-sufficient in assessing risks without
needing the champion to be present.

By embedding a risk awareness doctrine into the daily workflow,
engineering teams can build more secure and resilient systems from
the ground up. This proactive approach not only prevents potential
vulnerabilities but also fosters a culture of security mindfulness across the
entire organization. When risk awareness and threat modelling become
second nature, security culture improves organically, without the
need for dry and often ignored security awareness programs.

Equipping employees with the skills to effectively threat model naturally
enhances overall security awareness. Different teams, however, have
different perspectives and needs. For example, engineering teams
threat modelling a web application will approach it differently than the
finance team assessing financial risks. Therefore, targeted training
tailored to the specific contexts and challenges of different teams is crucial.

A workforce adept at identifying and assessing risks is inherently more
aware of security principles. This intrinsic understanding helps prevent
common security issues, such as phishing attacks, often more effectively than
 separate, often overlooked training sessions.

When everyone in the organization is engaged in threat modelling and
risk assessment, security becomes a shared responsibility. This
collective effort leads to a more robust security posture, reducing
the frequency and impact of security incidents. It also means
that security practices are woven into the fabric of daily operations,
making them more relevant and less likely to be disregarded.

This shift, adopting a risk awareness doctrine and integrating
it into everyday practices can lead to a more secure,
resilient, and agile organization. By fostering a culture of
security awareness through ubiquitous and tailored threat modelling,
companies can mitigate risks more effectively and enhance their
overall security posture. This approach ensures that security
is not an afterthought but a fundamental aspect of the
organization's DNA, benefiting both the business and its stakeholders.

## Now what, How do I actually get started?

To help you develop a risk awareness mindset, here are some simple and effective steps:

- **Situational Awareness:**
  - Pay more attention to your surroundings and the potential risks they might pose.
  - Think about how things might go wrong in any task or situation.
  - Practice noticing details and questioning assumptions in everyday life. For example, when you enter a building, note the exits and think about how you would react in an emergency, or consider what might happen if you sent a message to the wrong person.

- **Identify Valuable Assets:**
  - Determine what you value most in different situations, such as your personal data, financial information, or physical safety.
  - Focus on protecting these important things by understanding what could potentially harm them.

- **Think Like an Attacker:**
  - Imagine yourself in the shoes of someone who might exploit weaknesses. What would they target? How would they take advantage of gaps or oversights?
  - Consider everyday scenarios, like leaving your phone unattended, to spot vulnerabilities you might usually overlook.

- **What Could Go Wrong?:**
  - Consider what could go wrong and how it might affect you. Think about which problems are more serious and which ones are less likely to happen.
  - Get into the habit of quickly evaluating risks in everyday decisions, like sharing personal information or engaging in risky activities.

- **Implement Safeguards:**
  - Regularly apply basic protective measures. Use strong passwords, keep your belongings secure, and stay aware of your surroundings.
  - In physical scenarios, practice habits like locking doors and keeping an eye on your valuables.

- **Reflect and Learn:**
  - After facing a potential threat or making a decision, take a moment to reflect on what you did well and what could be improved.
  - Learning from real-life experiences reinforces your risk awareness skills and makes the process more natural over time.

By keeping these in mind, you can develop a risk awareness mindset that becomes second nature, helping you navigate both
everyday situations and complex challenges with confidence and security. This kind of mindset forms a solid
foundation for more technical threat modelling processes used in professional settings. Developing these
skills not only improves your general security awareness but also prepares you for more advanced security
practices, making you better equipped to handle and mitigate risks in all aspects of life.

## Final Thoughts

Embracing risk awareness as a doctrine in our decision-making process elevates our approach to both
professional and personal challenges. It empowers us to anticipate potential threats, make informed
decisions, and implement effective safeguards. By adopting this structured framework, we not only enhance
the security and quality of our work but also cultivate a proactive mindset that can navigate the
complexities of everyday life with confidence.

In a world where threats are ubiquitous and constantly evolving, integrating risk awareness into our daily
routine is not just a best practice—it's a necessity. Whether we're designing cutting-edge
software, crossing the street, or making significant purchases online, the principles of risk
awareness can guide us towards more secure and informed decisions. Let's embrace this doctrine and
transform the way we perceive and respond to risks, one decision at a time.
