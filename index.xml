      <description>So, firstly I want to start with an apology. I relaunched the site back in October 2019 but then it went dark, no content, no updates, nothing. Well it turned out at the time that my Dad&amp;rsquo;s illness (throat Cancer) had taken a major turn for the worse; we were told that there was only one outcome remaining and to make the best of the time we had left.
He had an operation in October to attempt to remove the lymph nodes that the cancer had metastacised into but because of how far it had spread into his neck, it was impossible to clear fully.</description>

      <description>The Gold standard for information security professionals, I would advise anybody working in IT Security to do this course. Its benefit lies in understanding, as a techie I gained a deeper understanding and appreciation of how the Policy and process side of Security works.</description>

      <description>For my birthday this year, my wife bought me a Drone to help me get into the hobby, the chosen beast was The Mambo FPV.
Unboxing and getting it setup was fairly straight forward. The battery comes pre-charged to around 60% and thats enough for a quick first flight&amp;hellip; and crash!!!!
Damn! getting your head around the controls is hard for a newbie.
Everything about flying a drone is co-ordination. the left stick controls the Z-Axis, movement up and down is via the Throttling up and down on the left stick, Rotation about the Z-Axis, Yaw, is left and right on the left stick.</description>

      <description>Obtained a much deeper understanding of AWS and especially its capabilities and limitations with respect to securing cloud workloads. A much deeper dive into the services offered by AWS and how a broad collection of those services come together to form solution stacks. It also provides the students with much needed detail on migrating workloads to the cloud, where there is still high demand at present with regards to cloud projects.</description>

      <description>Excellent course to learn the intricacies of AWS and round out the knowledge gained on the Job. Using AWS day to day for a number of years on mainly development oriented projects its easy to overlook the more infrastructure targeted services. This course gives an understanding of those offerings and places them in context to aid in their understanding.</description>

      <description>An excellent introduction to the ways a hacker works to compromise a system. Despite it being widely disparaged by the Cybersecurity community, I found it to be insightful and good all-round introductory course. There are some questions around the dubious title and the format of the exam, but content is valid and useful especially for someone without a background in offensive security.</description>

      <description>A very insightful course into art of computer forensics and the techniques that are used to catch hackers. Very interesting to take the knowledge gained here and work out ways to evade them, excellent course to take that stage further and develop the adversarial mindset.</description>

      <description>Inspired by Rob and his Shiva project to automatically create an attack ready ubuntu host, I decided to expand on the concept and automate the deployment of not only an attack host, but an environment where you can perform all manner of cyber-sec activities from anywhere you choose has an internet connection. Activities such as:
 Windows Malware Analysis. Exploit Development CTFs OS, Tool and Technique Exploration  </description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Chris. I am a Hacker, Engineer and Geek. I have a passion for all things Cyber Security, but my main areas of focus are in Hardware &amp;ldquo;hacking&amp;rdquo; (making and breaking) and the Cloud. You can never know everything, but knowledge is power; so I always strive to learn something new as often as family, life and work allow.
I am also a motorcyclist and boulderer when not chasing around after 2 kids and my darling wife.</description>

Courses (upcoming and in Progress)  Penetration Testing With Kali  The precursor course to the OSCP examination. Its very difficult to put into words how much I have learned from this course so far, and there is always more to learn #TryHarder.</description>
