      <description>Inspired by Rob and his Shiva project to automatically create an attack ready ubuntu host, I decided to expand on the concept and automate the deployment of not only an attack host, but an environment where you can perform all manner of cyber-sec activities from anywhere you choose has an internet connection. Activities such as:
 Windows Malware Analysis. Exploit Development CTFs OS, Tool and Technique Exploration  </description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Chris. I am a Hacker, Developer and Geek. I have a passion for all things Cyber Security, but my main areas of focus are in Hardware &amp;ldquo;hacking&amp;rdquo; (making and breaking) and the Cloud. You can never know everything, but knowledge is power; so I always strive to learn something new as often as family, work and life allow.
I am also a motorcyclist and boulderer when not chasing around after 2 kids and my darling wife.</description>
