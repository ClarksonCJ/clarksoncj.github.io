      <description>So, firstly I want to start with an apology. I relaunched the site back in October 2019 but then it went dark, no content, no updates, nothing. Well it turned out at the time that my Dad&amp;rsquo;s illness (throat Cancer) had taken a major turn for the worse; we were told that there was only one outcome remaining and to make the best of the time we had left.
He had an operation in October to attempt to remove the lymph nodes that the cancer had metastacised into but because of how far it had spread into his neck, it was impossible to clear fully.</description>
