      <description>For my birthday this year, my wife bought me a Drone to help me get into the hobby, the drone chosen was The Mambo FPV.
Unboxing and getting it setup was fairly straight forward. The battery comes pre-charged to around 60% and thats enough for a quick first flight&amp;hellip; and crash!!!!
Damn! getting your head around the controls is hard for a newbie.
Everything about flying a drone is co-ordination. the left stick controls the Z-Axis, movement up and down is via the Throttling up and down on the left stick, Rotation about the Z-Axis, Yaw, is left and right on the left stick.</description>
