title: New Blog!

Welcome to my new Blog. 

I have moved it from a Wordpress hosted site to Github pages, cos basically... Wordpress is bad. Base installation got hacked (and no there was no default username/password combination) and Godaddy were kind enough to email me about it.

I intend to start doing bitesized blogs on security and development topics in the near future. but first I need to pull together a list of things to write about.
